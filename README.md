# seeker-app
SEEKER is a mobile application, built with Kotlin for Android OS. 

SEEKER is a geo-location centered missing persons app. Users of the app can report a missing person, or they can view posts from other people. 
The posts they receive in their feed will be ones that are in a 5km - 10km radius. 

One of the main features is an "Alert" button that a user presses to notify the seeker that the missing person has been spotted, using push notifications.

SEEKER is intended for university-going women, parents and other demographics that are vulnerable to human trafficking and other crimes, in small and
large communities. 

People who use SEEKER will shorten the response time, because their feed will only show them what is happening closest to them,  and that will reduce human rights violations against the most vulnerable.
